# Usage of Corona Apps

This repository contains a modified version of [PaxCounter](https://github.com/cyberman54/ESP32-Paxcounter).

The version checks for the amount of bluetooth devices, which send out the exposure notification packets
used by the "Corona Warn App" in Germany and other apps using the exposure notification framework
provided by Apple and Google.
